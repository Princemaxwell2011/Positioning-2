        <p style="text-indent: 50px; color: burlywood; box-sizing: content-box;">Robotics is the intersection of
            science, engineering and technology that produces machines, called robots, that
            replicate or substitute for human actions. Robots perform basic and repetitive tasks with greater efficiency
            and
            accuracy than humans, making them ideal for industries like manufacturing. However, the introduction of
            artificial
            intelligence in robotics has given robots the ability to handle increasingly complex situations in various
            industries.</p>

        <h2 style="box-shadow: 3px 4px 5px black;font-size: 30px;text-align: center;position: sticky;">What Is a Robot?
        </h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> A robot is a programmable machine that can complete a task, while the term
            robotics describes the field of study focused
            on developing robots and automation. Each robot has a different level of autonomy. These levels range from
            human-controlled bots that carry out tasks to fully-autonomous bots that perform tasks without any external
            influences.</p>

        <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">In terms of etymology, the word ‘robot’ is derived from the Czech word robota,
            which means “forced labor.” The word
            first appeared in the 1920 play R.U.R., in reference to the play’s characters who were mass-produced workers
            incapable
            of creative thinking.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 style="box-shadow: 5px 6px 7px;">Robotics Aspects</h3><br>

        <p><b>Mechanical Construction:</b><br><br>
            The mechanical aspect of a robot helps it complete tasks in the environment for which it’s designed. For
            example, the
            Mars 2020 Rover’s wheels are individually motorized and made of titanium tubing that help it firmly grip the
            harsh
            terrain of the red planet.

            Electrical Components
            Robots need electrical components that control and power the machinery. Essentially, an electric current — a
            battery,
            for example — is needed to power a large majority of robots.

        <p><b>Software Program:</b> <br><br>
            Robots contain at least some level of computer programming. Without a set of code telling it what to do, a
            robot would
            just be another piece of simple machinery. Inserting a program into a robot gives it the ability to know
            when and how to
            carry out a task.</p>

        <strong><b>What Are the Main Components of a Robot?</b><br><br></strong>

        <b>Control System:</b><br><br>
        Computation includes all of the components that make up a robot’s central processing unit, often referred to as
        its
        control system. Control systems are programmed to tell a robot how to utilize its specific components, similar
        in some
        ways to how the human brain sends signals throughout the body, in order to complete a specific task. These
        robotic tasks
        could comprise anything from minimally invasive surgery to assembly <br><br>




        <b>Sensors:</b><br><br>
        Sensors provide a robot with stimuli in the form of electrical signals that are processed by the controller and
        allow
        the robot to interact with the outside world. Common sensors found within robots include video cameras that
        function as
        eyes, photoresistors that react to light and microphones that operate like ears. These sensors allow the robot
        to
        capture its surroundings and process the most logical conclusion based on the current moment and allows the
        controller
        to relay commands to the additional.<br><br>


        <b>Actuators:</b><br><br>
        A device can only be considered to be a robot if it has a movable frame or body. Actuators are the components
        that are
        responsible for this movement. These components are made up of motors that receive signals from the control
        system and
        move in tandem to carry out the movement necessary to complete the assigned task. Actuators can be made of a
        variety of
        materials, such as metal or elastic, and are commonly operated by use of compressed air (pneumatic actuators) or
        oil
        (hydraulic actuators) but come in a variety of formats to best fulfill their specialized roles. <br><br>

        <b> Power Supply: <br><br></b>
        Like the human body requires food in order to function, robots require power. Stationary robots, such as those
        found in
        a factory, may run on AC power through a wall outlet but more commonly, robots operate via an internal battery.
        Most
        robots utilize lead-acid batteries for their safe qualities and long shelf life while others may utilize the
        more
        compact but also more expensive silver-cadmium variety. Safety, weight, replaceability and lifecycle are all
        important
        factors to consider when designing a robot’s power supply. <br><br>

        Some potential power sources for future robotic development also include pneumatic power from compressed gasses,
        solar
        power, hydraulic power, flywheel energy storage organic garbage through anaerobic digestion and nuclear power.
        <br><br>

        <b>End Effectors: <br><br></b>
        End effectors are the physical, typically external components that allow robots to finish carrying out their
        tasks.
        Robots in factories often have interchangeable tools like paint sprayers and drills, surgical robots may be
        equipped
        with scalpels and other kinds of robots can be built with gripping claws or even hands for tasks like
        deliveries,
        packing, bomb diffusion and much more.
